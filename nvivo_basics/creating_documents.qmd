## Why Create Documents in NVivo?

In most cases, you’ll import transcripts or notes from external files. But there are a few excellent reasons to create documents directly inside NVivo:

- 📝 **Activity Logs**: Jot down what you did in each session for future reference or team communication.
- 🔧 **Fix Transcripts**: Correct transcription errors *inside NVivo* without re-importing or re-coding.
- 📚 **Appendix Material**: Useful for documenting your research process in a structured way.

Example log entries:

```
16 Aug – Imported volunteer interviews from Melbourne  
19 Aug – First pass of Ken’s interview: initial themes  
30 Aug – Ran search for “career”, saved query but not results  
```

## How to Create a Document

There are two main ways:

### 🛠️ Method 1: Use the Create Ribbon

1. Go to the **Create** tab in the Ribbon.
2. Click the **Document** button (page icon).
3. The "New Document" dialog appears.

### 🖱️ Method 2: Right-Click in List View

1. Go to **Files** in the Navigation View.
2. Right-click in the **List View** and select:
   - **New File** > **New Document**

This approach is great when the Ribbon isn't visible or responsive.

## The New Document Dialog

You'll see two fields:

- **Name** – like a filename (e.g., `Activity Diary`)
- **Description** – longer text (e.g., _“Short notes on tasks carried out in NVivo during data analysis.”_)

There’s also an **Attribute Values** tab — this is typically **not needed** for journal-like documents.

::: {.callout-tip}
Keep a single document as an internal log to track your project’s progress over time.

## Contextual Behavior

Once you create or open a document:

- The **Ribbon** updates with new tabs:
  - `Document` tab
  - `Edit` tab
- If nothing shows in the **List View**, click **Refresh** or check the filters.

::: {.callout-warning}
Right-click menus and ribbon options depend on *where you last clicked*. If things disappear, check your focus!
