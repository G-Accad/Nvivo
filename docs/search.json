    "section": "8.2 Recommended Workflow",
    "text": "8.2 Recommended Workflow\nWe recommend a 3-step process:\n\n8.2.1 1. Prepare NVivo to Receive Transcripts\n\n8.2.1.1 Create a Subfolder\n\nGo to the Files section under Data in the Navigation View.\nCreate a new folder (e.g., Transcripts).\nGive it a clear name and description.\n\nExample: &gt; Folder: Transcripts\n&gt; Description: “Interviews on volunteering experiences”\n\n\n8.2.1.2 Set Up File Classifications (Optional)\nUseful if you want to attach metadata (e.g., gender, role, location) to each transcript file.\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2 2. Prepare Your Transcripts\nThis step makes the import more structured and helps with later analysis.\n\n8.2.2.1 Speaker Identifiers\nStart each speech turn with a label: - Int: Interviewer - PtA, PtB, etc.: Participants\n- Or use first names (with caution re: bias & anonymity)\nInt: Can you tell me about your volunteer role?\nAnna: I started volunteering in 2021...\n\n\n8.2.2.2 Use Heading Styles\nIf your interviews follow a structured protocol, use Word’s Heading 1 / 2 styles for questions or sections. This enables auto-coding by structure.\n\n\n8.2.2.3 Add Timestamps (for Audio Link)\nIf syncing to an audio file, insert timestamps like [00:02:15] at the start of each speaker turn. NVivo can use this to sync transcript and audio.\n\n\n\n\n8.2.3 3. Importing the Documents\n\nNavigate to Files in NVivo.\nClick the Import tab in the Ribbon.\nChoose Documents and select your transcripts from disk.\n\n\nNVivo won’t know your last used folder — navigate to the correct directory manually.\n\nImported documents will appear in your project under the selected folder, ready to code, classify, or query.",
