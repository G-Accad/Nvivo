## Why Import?

Most researchers transcribe interviews using Word or a transcription service. Rather than copy/paste or retype content into NVivo, you can **import multiple transcripts at once** — clean, efficient, and avoids rework.

---

## Recommended Workflow

We recommend a **3-step process**:

### 1. Prepare NVivo to Receive Transcripts

#### Create a Subfolder
- Go to the **Files** section under **Data** in the Navigation View.
- Create a new folder (e.g., **Transcripts**).
- Give it a clear name and description.

Example:
> Folder: `Transcripts`  
> Description: *“Interviews on volunteering experiences”*

#### Set Up File Classifications *(Optional)*
Useful if you want to attach metadata (e.g., gender, role, location) to each transcript file.

### 2. Prepare Your Transcripts

This step makes the import more structured and helps with later analysis.

#### Speaker Identifiers
Start each speech turn with a label:
- `Int`: Interviewer
- `PtA`, `PtB`, etc.: Participants  
- Or use first names (with caution re: bias & anonymity)

```text
Int: Can you tell me about your volunteer role?
Anna: I started volunteering in 2021...
```

#### Use Heading Styles
If your interviews follow a structured protocol, use Word’s **Heading 1 / 2** styles for questions or sections. This enables **auto-coding** by structure.

#### Add Timestamps (for Audio Link)
If syncing to an audio file, insert timestamps like `[00:02:15]` at the start of each speaker turn. NVivo can use this to sync transcript and audio.

### 3. Importing the Documents

1. Navigate to **Files** in NVivo.
2. Click the **Import** tab in the Ribbon.
3. Choose **Documents** and select your transcripts from disk.

> NVivo won’t know your last used folder — navigate to the correct directory manually.

Imported documents will appear in your project under the selected folder, ready to code, classify, or query.

## Wrapping Up

Being intentional about how you import and format your transcripts gives you cleaner data and smoother analysis later on.
