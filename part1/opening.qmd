## Opening NVivo

To open NVivo on Windows, go to the **Start Menu**, navigate to the **QSR folder**, and select **NVivo 14**. Upon launch, you’ll be greeted with a welcome screen.

Some options like "Sign In" and "Collaboration Cloud" may not apply to institutional users (e.g., University of Sheffield), and will show a message if not configured.

### Useful Areas on the Start Screen

- **Getting Started**  
  This section includes video tutorials and guides on:
  - Preparing transcripts for import
  - Formatting survey data for NVivo
  - Conducting thematic analysis
  - Writing memos or journals

- **Help System**  
  NVivo uses a **question mark (?)** icon instead of the word "Help". Look for this icon throughout the software to access help resources.

- **Learn and Connect**  
  Includes links to NVivo's learning materials and social platforms.

- **Recent Projects**  
  A quick-access list of projects you’ve recently worked on.

## Creating a New Project

To start working in NVivo, you’ll need to create a **project file**. This file will hold all your:
- Interview transcripts
- Coding
- Annotations
- Queries
- Reports

### Steps

1. Click the **New Project** button (white button on the left).
2. A dialog box will appear asking you to:
   - **Name** your project
   - **Choose a save location**
   - Optionally, add a **description**

Once saved, your project will open and you can begin importing data or documents.

::: {.callout-tip}
Use clear, concise project names. For example: `qualitative_study_2025.nvp`
