## NVivo Environment Overview

Once you create or open a project in NVivo, you’ll see the main workspace — a clean layout divided into useful panes, tabs, and ribbons.

To give you a proper tour, it’s easier to use a **sample project** so that the screen contains actual data and features to show.

## The Ribbon

The **Ribbon** in NVivo is the toolbar that runs along the top. It contains all major tools and is grouped into several tabs:

### File (Blue Button)

- Opens the **Project menu**, which allows you to save, close, or copy the project.
- Opens a separate screen (not a ribbon).
- Used occasionally, mostly for file-level operations.

### Home Tab

- Central hub for common actions:
  - Coding
  - Running queries
  - Viewing data visualizations

### Import Tab

- Used to bring external content into NVivo:
  - Word, PDF, images, video/audio
  - Survey data (e.g., from Qualtrics)
  - Bibliographic data (EndNote, Mendeley)

### Create Tab

- Lets you create content **within NVivo**:
  - Documents and memos (basic word processing tools included)
  - Framework matrices
  - Nodes (codes)

::: {.callout-tip}
You can write directly in NVivo instead of using Word or Google Docs — great for journaling or annotations.
:::

### Explore Tab

- Access searches and exploration tools.
- Go beyond coding with:
  - Word frequency and text search
  - Cluster analysis
  - Social network analysis

::: {.callout-note}
NVivo’s search and exploration tools have been core to its power since the early **Nud*IST** days.
:::

### Share Tab

- Export your work to share with others:
  - Reports as Word or Excel
  - Images of visualizations
  - Codebooks or queries

Note: NVivo doesn’t support direct posting to social media or emailing content.

### Modules Tab

- Integrates with extra NVivo modules:
  - **Transcription service** (automated, paid)
  - **Collaboration Cloud** (not currently supported by all institutions)
  - **Microsoft OneDrive integration**

::: {.callout-warning}
Always check with your institution about data protection before using cloud-based features like Collaboration Cloud.
:::

## Contextual Ribbons

Contextual ribbons appear **based on what you're working on**.

For example, if you're editing a document, you’ll see the **Document ribbon** with relevant tools. If you’re not in a document, it disappears.

This can be confusing — just remember: **where you click matters**.

## Top-Right Utility Icons

At the top-right of the NVivo window, you’ll see small icons:

- **Login icon** – Often non-functional in institutional setups
- **Save icon** – Save your current project (like other apps)

This completes the visual and functional tour of NVivo’s interface.
