## About NVivo Projects

In NVivo, everything you work on—transcripts, codes, annotations, memos, and queries—is saved within a **single project file**. Creating a project is the first step before you can begin importing data or doing any analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Version Compatibility

The University of Sheffield currently uses **NVivo 14**.

> ⚠️ Projects created in NVivo 14 are **not backwards-compatible** with earlier versions.\
> However, older NVivo projects (v12 and earlier) **can be opened** in NVivo 14.

Ensure that everyone you collaborate with is using the **same version** to avoid compatibility issues.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Starting a New Project

To begin, open NVivo and click the **New Project** button on the welcome screen.

This opens a setup dialog with several fields to complete.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Title, File Name, and Save Location

You'll first be prompted to provide a **project title**. This name appears in the NVivo interface.

Then, NVivo will auto-generate a file name (e.g., `My Project.nvp`) and a default save location. You can change these by clicking the **Browse** button:

-   **Change the directory** by navigating to your preferred folder
-   **Change the file name** directly in the file name field

> 💡 Example: Instead of `Interviews with Volunteers`, you might save your file as `volunteers.nvp`

Note: Changing the file name does **not** change the project title—these are independent fields.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Description and Language

You can also add a short **description** of your project. For example:

> “These interviews were conducted in 2024 as part of a qualitative study on student volunteering.”

Then, choose the **Text Content Language** from the dropdown (e.g., **English (UK)**).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Autosave and Recovery Settings

After clicking **Next**, you’ll see options for how NVivo should handle saving and backups.

-   **Autosave** (saves every \~15 minutes automatically)
-   **Prompt to Save** at regular intervals (e.g., every 30–60 minutes)

You can change these later in the settings, so don’t worry too much about getting it perfect.

> 💡 Autosave is recommended if you're concerned about crashes or data loss.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Finishing Setup

Click **Create Project** to finish the setup.

NVivo may offer to give you a tour of the software. You can skip it or explore it later.

> 📝 Tip: To avoid seeing the tour again, tick “Do not show tour again” at the bottom-left of the window.

You're now ready to begin importing your data or creating internal documents in your new NVivo project.
